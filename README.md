# GwyddionResearch2022

### Hello researchers! 
This github repository functions as a hub for all iterations of code required to conduct cross sectional grain analysis from AFM images using Gwyddion analytical sofware and a bit of python.

First, you will need to install Gwyddion 32 bit version [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gwyddion/files/gwyddion/2.62/Gwyddion-2.62.win32.exe/download).

You will need the 32 bit version in order to utilize [Pygwy Scripting](http://gwyddion.net/documentation/user-guide-en/pygwy.html), which allows us to manipulate the software and extract pertinent data in one shot.
[Documentation](http://gwyddion.net/documentation/head/pygwy/) and the [forums](https://sourceforge.net/p/gwyddion/discussion/) for Gwyddion and Pygwy Scripting will come in handy in a pinch.

You will also need to install the latest version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Python2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/)

Just in case you have any trouble getting the Pygwy Console in Gwyddion to appear under the *Data Process* field [this](https://sourceforge.net/p/gwyddion/discussion/pygwy/thread/75317bfd11/) forum thread should help.

### After,
you are able to complete the instructions above we can move on to the code and some sample data.

Install wsl2 (Ubuntu)
